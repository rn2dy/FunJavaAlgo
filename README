This is an Java GUI application, for demonstration of two things in Algorithms class:
	1. 2/3 Tree (a kind of blanced multi-node tree)
    2. Shortest Path algorithm, use the famouse algorithms:
       - Bellman Ford
       - Dijkstra

The program is very easy to compile :-)
	$ javac *.java

    Or (use the following to see the type safe information, you might want to help me to fix it.)
    $ javac -Xlint:unchecked *.java

Features: 
	It calculates the shortest path, and it constructs 2/3 tree.
	It has graphics to let you interact with the application.
      - insert nodes, print tree
      - choose different algorithms when compute shortest path
    * It is easy to scale to different format of input, currently it only support.
